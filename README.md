# Rendrjs
![Tests](https://github.com/rendr-js/rendrjs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Rendrjs is a framework for building web user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** Create interactive UIs with simple, declarative code. Define what your component should look like, and when the state changes, Rendrjs will update the DOM for you.
* **Component-based:** Build complex UIs with simple, reusable components that manage their own state.
* **Easy:** Rendrjs UIs are written in pure JavaScript / TypeScript. No need to learn JSX or template directives, and no need for build plugins.
* **Light-weight:** Rendrjs bundles are 3x smaller than Svelte bundles, and 25x smaller than React bundles.
* **Efficient:** Rendrjs is fast and leaves a small memory footprint.
